#### How do I publish my pages?
You'll first need to export your pages out of Blocks Edit: In the visual editor, after saving your updates, click **Export** at the top.

If you added images to your pages, you'll have to host them somewhere. You can use the Blocks Edit [FTP integration](https://blocksedit.com/help/integrations/ftp-sftp-setup/) to upload to your site.

Otherwise, you'll [have the option](https://blocksedit.com/help/editor/export-landing-page/) to download your images which you will then need to upload manually to your host, and update the image paths in your pages' HTML code.

To publish your page, you'll need to import your saved HTML to your hosting provider where your public content goes.
